1. Install Apache Oozie and Hadoop.
2. Create Hadoop tasks that can be controlled to take a certain computation time
and to produce output of a certain size.
3. Test a simple workflow that uses the tasks defined above.
4. Define how to name workflow intermediate datasets based on provenance.
5. Explore what is the best way to recreate the Oozie REST API.
6. Create the Accounting Module. Design the data modeling of what is needed
for accounting. Probably use No-sql database.
7. Create the Execution Module that submits the workflows to Oozie.
8. Create the Decision Module that reads from the Accounting Module.
9. Create the Actuator Module (if needed).
